# PRODIGY_CS_01=Implementing Caesar Cipher in Python
The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. Named after Julius Caesar, it was used for secure military communication. It's a type of substitution cipher, easy to implement and understand. Despite its simplicity, it laid the groundwork for modern cryptography. However, it's easily broken with brute force or frequency analysis.
